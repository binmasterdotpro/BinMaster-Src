### Why is this being released?
As a member of the team at BinMaster, it is with a heavy heart that we have made the decision to release the source code for our Minecraft bots for the Hypixel server. We poured countless hours of our time and energy into developing this software, perfecting every line of code and tirelessly testing it to ensure its quality. However, circumstances beyond our control have left us with no other choice. Our company has faced a series of setbacks, from a lack of funding to internal conflicts, and we simply cannot continue to operate in the same capacity.

Releasing the source code feels like a final act of desperation, a way to salvage something from the ruins of our once-promising company. We hope that others in the Minecraft botting community will find value in our work and build upon it, creating something even better than what we were able to achieve. Perhaps this will be our legacy, a small but significant contribution to the world of gaming and technology.

As we bid farewell to the software that we poured so much of ourselves into, we can't help but feel a sense of sadness and loss. But we take comfort in the knowledge that our work will live on, and that others will be able to benefit from the passion and dedication that we poured into it.
